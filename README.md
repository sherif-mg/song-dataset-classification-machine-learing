SVM is a supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by finding the optimal hyperplane that separates different classes in the feature space. For non-linearly separable data, SVM uses kernel functions to map the data into a higher-dimensional space.

**Dataset Description**</br></br>  
  Song Dataset</br>
    The dataset includes features such as tempo, key, and duration of songs.</br>
    The goal is to classify songs into different genres or categories.

**Features**</br>
Tempo: Speed of the song in beats per minute.</br>
Key: Musical key of the song.</br>
Duration: Length of the song in seconds.</br>
**Methodology**</br>
**Data Preprocessing**</br>
Handling Missing Values: Impute or remove missing values.</br>
Normalization: Scale features to a standard range.</br>
Encoding Categorical Features: Convert categorical features into numerical values.</br>
**Training the SVM Model**</br>
Splitting the Data: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.</br>
Selecting the Kernel: Choose a kernel function (e.g., linear, RBF).</br>
Training the Model: Fit the SVM model using the training set.</br>
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize parameters for best performance.</br>
**Evaluation Metrics**</br>
Precision: Measures the accuracy of positive predictions.</br>
Recall: Measures the ability to identify all relevant instances.</br>
F1-Score: Balances precision and recall.</br>
